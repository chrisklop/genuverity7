## DELIVERABLE: TOP 5 DISINFORMATION TOPICS

For each of the 5 most viral disinformation topics currently spreading across InfoWars, Breitbart, X (Twitter), Reddit, Facebook, Truth Social, Telegram, and TikTok, provide:

### 1. FORENSIC ANALYSIS (Essay Format)

**Narrative & Status**
- Concise title
- Verdict: FABRICATED | MISLEADING | SKEWED | DEEPFAKE | CONTEXT NEEDED

**Root Cause Analysis**
- **Patient Zero**: Earliest detectable post, site, or account
- **Propagation Vector**: Bot Injection (sudden spike of low-follower accounts) | State-Sourced (linked to known foreign actor IP blocks) | Algorithmic Exploitation | Organic Viral
- **Forensic Markers**: AI synthetic signatures (e.g., "Artifacts consistent with Flux.1," "Syntactic patterns of LLM-generated astroturfing")

**Why This Spread**
- What legitimate concern does it tap into?
- What kernel of truth (if any) was distorted?
- What made it emotionally compelling?

**Full Analysis**
- 3-5 paragraphs of detailed forensic examination
- Inline citations using [N] notation
- Evidence-first presentation

### 2. SOURCE DOCUMENTATION

For EACH topic, provide 10-15 sources:
- **NO Wikipedia** — find primary sources
- Include: .gov sources, court dockets (PACER), official transcripts, fact-checkers (PolitiFact, Snopes, FactCheck.org)
- For each source: title, URL, verbatim quote, credibility score (1-5 per GenuVerity Rubric)

**GenuVerity Credibility Rubric:**
- 5/5 (Primary): Live data, official court dockets, White House/Gov transcripts
- 4/5 (Verified): Editorial oversight (AP, Reuters, WSJ)
- 3/5 (Regional): High-quality localized/specialized reporting
- 2/5 (Partisan): Biased framing, omitted context, inflammatory language
- 1/5 (Malign): Known hoax history, anonymous sourcing, bot-driven
