# Archive Directory

This directory contains deprecated/archived versions of the application that are kept for reference but are NOT actively used.

## Contents

### `infinite-archive-app-committed.html`
- **Description**: The original "Infinite Archive" app - a 15,000+ line single-page application with side panels and interactive report generation
- **Title**: "GenuVerity | The Infinite Archive"
- **Status**: ARCHIVED - Not in active use
- **Why archived**: Replaced by the simpler "TRUTH IS NOW" landing page design

### `infinite-archive-app.html`
- **Description**: Another variant of the full app (saved from `index-full.html`)
- **Status**: ARCHIVED - Not in active use

## Important

These files should NOT be deployed as the main `index.html`. The current landing page is the "TRUTH IS NOW" version (~2,200 lines).

If you need to reference the old app functionality, look at these files. But do not copy them to `index.html` or deploy them.
