 # **A Comprehensive Longitudinal Study of Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against Donald J. Trump and Comparative Analysis of Disciplinary Outcomes Within the Jeffrey Epstein Network**

The historical record concerning allegations of sexual misconduct brought against Donald J. Trump is a complex mosaic of personal testimony, civil litigation, and political discourse. Since the 1970s, a minimum of 28 women have publicly accused Trump of a wide spectrum of nonconsensual sexual behaviors, ranging from inappropriate touching and harassment to forcible sexual assault and rape.1 The emergence of these claims has occurred in distinct waves, often synchronized with political milestones or broader cultural shifts, such as the 2016 presidential campaign and the subsequent global resurgence of the MeToo movement. This report provides an exhaustive accounting of the claimants, assesses the substantiation of their allegations within the American legal framework, and compares these outcomes with the disciplinary measures taken against other high-profile figures identified in the investigative files of the late Jeffrey Epstein.

## **Historical Enumeration of Accusers and Allegations**

The documentation of claims against Donald Trump reveals a pattern of alleged behavior spanning over four decades. These allegations are not confined to a single demographic or professional environment but rather include former spouses, business associates, media professionals, and contestants within the beauty pageant circuit he owned. The following narrative details the specific claimants and the nature of their respective accusations, as documented in media reports, sworn depositions, and court filings.

### **The Pageant Circuit and Modeling Industry**

A significant cluster of allegations originates from the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants, which Trump owned for nearly two decades. Claimants in this category often describe a persistent environment of objectification and physical boundary violations.  
In 1997, during Trump's first year of ownership of the Miss USA contest, Temple Taggart McDowell, who competed as Miss Utah, alleged that Trump subjected her to unwanted kisses and embraces.2 McDowell recounted being warned by a chaperone never to be left alone in a room with him again, indicating an early awareness of potential risk among the pageant staff.2 In the same year, Mariah Billado and Victoria Hughes, competing in Miss Teen USA, reported that Trump entered the contestants' dressing room while several young women were in various stages of undress.1 Billado noted that some of the girls were as young as 15 at the time.5  
Similar accounts of dressing room intrusions surfaced in 2000 from Bridget Sullivan (Miss New Hampshire) and in 2001 from Tasha Dixon (Miss Arizona).4 Sullivan additionally alleged that Trump would place his hands "a little low on your back" in a manner she found inappropriate.4 Dixon described Trump as "waltzing in" while contestants were naked or half-naked, asserting that he did so because he knew he could exert such power as the owner.6 By 2006, the nature of the allegations from the pageant circuit became more aggressive. Samantha Holvey (Miss North Carolina) described feeling like "meat" as Trump personally inspected contestants from head to toe, while Ninni Laaksonen (Miss Finland) alleged that Trump squeezed her buttocks during a photoshoot before an appearance on the *Late Show with David Letterman*.3

### **Table 1: Accusers from the Pageant and Modeling Domains**

| Beatrice Keul | 1993 | Forcible groping | Plaza Hotel | Daily Mail 2 |
| Amy Dorris | 1997 | Groping and kissing | U.S. Open | Public disclosure 1 |

### **Business Associates and Professional Interactions**

The second major category of accusers consists of women who encountered Trump through business ventures or professional roles. These allegations frequently involve sudden, aggressive physical contact in corporate or high-stakes social environments.  
Jill Harth, a makeup artist and business partner who worked with Trump on the "American Dream" pageant in the early 1990s, filed a lawsuit in 1997 alleging a series of unwanted sexual advances.7 Harth claimed that during a dinner in 1992, Trump groped her under the table, and in January 1993 at Mar-a-Lago, he allegedly pushed her against a wall and attempted to go up her dress in one of his children's bedrooms.7 Although she dropped her lawsuit after her romantic partner settled a separate business dispute with Trump, Harth reaffirmed her allegations in 2016, stating they were not politically motivated.7  
In 2005, Rachel Crooks, a 22-year-old receptionist at a firm located in Trump Tower, reported that after she introduced herself to Trump outside an elevator, he refused to let go of her hand and kissed her directly on the mouth.3 In the same year, Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for *People* magazine, alleged that while she was at Mar-a-Lago to interview Trump and his pregnant wife Melania, Trump took her into a private room and "forced his tongue down my throat".3 Summer Zervos, a former contestant on *The Apprentice*, alleged that in 2007, Trump groped her and kissed her aggressively on two separate occasions at Trump Tower and the Beverly Hills Hotel.3 Zervos later filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump, which was settled without compensation in 2021\.3

### **Private and Social Encounters**

Individual accusers from personal or semi-private social settings have provided some of the most enduring accounts. Jessica Leeds alleged that in the early 1980s, while seated next to Trump in first class on a flight to New York, he lifted the armrest and began grabbing her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt.2 Leeds described the experience as an "assault," stating Trump was "like an octopus" whose hands were everywhere.2  
Perhaps the most legally significant allegation came from E. Jean Carroll, a prominent advice columnist who claimed that in late 1995 or early 1996, Trump recognized her at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan.12 Carroll alleged that after a brief, playful interaction, they went into a dressing room where Trump shoved her against the wall and forcibly penetrated her.8 This account, while denied by Trump for decades, eventually became the basis for a multi-million dollar civil judgment.12

## **Substantiation: The Civil Liability Threshold**

The question of whether these allegations are "substantiated" requires a distinction between criminal conviction and civil liability. To date, Donald Trump has not been criminally charged or convicted of any sexual offense. However, the American civil court system has found him liable for sexual abuse in a case that carried significant evidentiary weight.

### **The Carroll Verdict and Judicially Established Facts**

In May 2023, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) reached a unanimous verdict in *Carroll II*.12 The jury found Trump liable for "sexual abuse" and defamation, awarding Carroll a total of $5 million in damages.12 While the jury did not find enough evidence to label the encounter "rape" under the specific, technical definition in New York’s criminal code—which requires penile penetration—the presiding judge, Lewis Kaplan, clarified that the jury's finding of sexual abuse meant they found he had "deliberately and forcibly penetrated Ms. Carroll’s vagina with his fingers".14

### **Table 2: Breakdown of Damages in E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump**

| Case | Legal Claim | Compensatory Damages | Punitive Damages | Total |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Carroll II (May 2023\) | Sexual Battery/Abuse | $2,000,000 | $20,000 | $2,020,000 |
| Carroll II (May 2023\) | Defamation (2022) | $2,700,000 | $280,000 | $2,980,000 |
| Carroll I (Jan 2024\) | Defamation (2019) | $18,300,000 | $65,000,000 | $83,300,000 |

The substantiation in the Carroll case was bolstered by the testimony of "outcry witnesses" Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin, to whom Carroll spoke shortly after the 1996 incident.15 Furthermore, the court permitted the testimony of Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff as "propensity" witnesses under Federal Rules of Evidence 413 and 415\.15 This legal mechanism allows a jury to consider a defendant's past alleged conduct to determine the likelihood of the specific assault in question.15 The jury’s decision to award millions in damages suggests they found the cumulative testimony of these three women to be credible and evidence of a persistent behavioral pattern.

### **Patterns of Non-Judicial Corroboration**

Other allegations remain in a state of partial substantiation through contemporaneous outcry or admission. Trump's own recorded statements in the 2005 *Access Hollywood* tape—where he bragged about kissing women without waiting and "grabbing them by the pussy"—were used by the Carroll jury as evidence of his propensity for the alleged behavior.2 Similarly, his admission to Howard Stern that he entered dressing rooms "because he could" provides a layer of factual support for the claims made by contestants Mariah Billado, Tasha Dixon, and others.4

| Accuser | Corroborating Evidence | Status of Claim |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Ivana Trump | 1990 Sworn Divorce Deposition | Allegation made; later softened but substance stood 2 |
| Jill Harth | 1997 Court Filing; Partner’s testimony | Allegation made; business suit settled 7 |
| Cathy Heller | Testimony of husband and children | Allegation corroborated by present witnesses 2 |
| E. Jean Carroll | SDNY Jury Verdict | Found liable for sexual abuse 12 |

## **The Epstein Network and the "Katie Johnson" Lawsuit**

The most severe and controversial allegation involving Trump intersects with the criminal network of Jeffrey Epstein. In 2016, a woman using the pseudonym "Jane Doe" or "Katie Johnson" filed a federal lawsuit alleging that she was recruited by Epstein and raped by both Epstein and Trump in 1994 when she was 13 years old.8  
The lawsuit included a detailed affidavit from a witness, "Tiffany Doe," who claimed she was hired by Epstein to recruit adolescent girls for parties.9 Tiffany Doe swore under penalty of perjury that she witnessed Trump rape the 13-year-old plaintiff on at least one occasion and saw him threaten the girl and her family with physical harm to ensure their silence.9 According to the filings, Trump and Epstein allegedly bickered over who should have taken the minor’s virginity.16  
Despite the extreme nature of these charges, the lawsuit was voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff in November 2016, and the allegations were never tested in a court of law.8 Trump’s legal team characterized the lawsuit as a "political tool" and a "hoax" intended to undermine his first presidential campaign.8 While the withdrawal prevented any formal substantiation, the association remains a focal point of public scrutiny, particularly as more documents from the Epstein investigations have been unsealed.

## **Comparative Discipline: The "Disciplined for Less" Analysis**

A critical component of the user's inquiry concerns whether others in the Epstein files have been "disciplined for less" than the allegations facing Donald Trump. A review of the professional and legal repercussions for Epstein’s associates suggests a disparity between the outcomes for corporate and institutional figures versus political leaders.

### **Professional Resignations and Removals**

Several high-profile individuals have suffered catastrophic career consequences not because they were convicted of sexual assault, but because they were found to have mismanaged their professional associations with Epstein or were untruthful about the extent of those ties.  
Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays, was forced to resign in 2021 following an investigation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).17 The FCA found that Staley had "misled" regulators regarding the depth of his relationship with Epstein, which included visiting Epstein’s private island and exchanging hundreds of emails after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution involving a minor.18 Staley was fined £1.8 million and permanently banned from senior roles in the UK's financial sector.19  
Leon Black, the former CEO of private equity firm Apollo Global Management, resigned in March 2021 after it was revealed he had transferred over $150 million to Epstein for tax and estate planning advice between 2012 and 2017\.18 While an independent investigation found no evidence that Black was involved in any criminal activity, the reputational damage and the perceived lack of transparency were deemed incompatible with his role at a major investment firm.18

### **Table 3: Disciplinary Repercussions for Epstein Associates**

| Name | Role | Nature of Association | Resulting Discipline |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Jes Staley | CEO, Barclays | "Close" professional ties; emails | Resignation; £1.8M fine; industry ban 18 |
| Leon Black | CEO, Apollo Global | Paid $158M for tax/estate advice | Forced early resignation 18 |
| Prince Andrew | Royal Family | Friendship; assault allegations | Stripped of military titles/duties; $16M settlement 17 |
| Alex Acosta | U.S. Labor Secretary | Negotiated 2008 "sweetheart deal" | Forced resignation (2019) 21 |
| Martin Nowak | Harvard Professor | Financial/Personal association | Two-year institutional sanction 23 |
| Jes Staley/Larry Summers | Executors | Named in Epstein’s will | Public/Professional scrutiny 19 |

### **Legal Repercussions and Settlements**

Prince Andrew, Duke of York, represents the most prominent instance of a figure who faced severe institutional discipline without a criminal conviction. After being accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager, the Prince was stripped of his military titles and "working royal" status by King Charles III.17 He eventually settled Giuffre’s civil lawsuit for an estimated £12 million ($16.3 million), though he continued to deny the allegations.17 This indicates that within the British monarchy, the mere association and the presence of a credible civil claim were sufficient for total removal from public life.  
In contrast, Donald Trump has maintained a position at the pinnacle of American political power despite a federal jury finding him liable for sexual abuse and multiple credible witnesses testifying to a pattern of assault.12 This suggests that "discipline" for these actions is not uniform but is instead dependent on the institutional framework governing the individual. While a CEO or a member of a royal family is subject to the standards of a board of directors or a monarch, a political figure like Trump relies on an electoral mandate, which can be resistant to even judicially established findings of misconduct.

## **Implications of the "Epstein Files" and Missing Records**

The search for a "client list" within the Epstein files has been a persistent theme of public interest. However, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) clarified in July 2025 that a singular "client list" containing names for blackmail purposes does not exist.25 Instead, the records consist of flight logs, contact directories, and deposition transcripts unsealed as part of the Virginia Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell litigation.25  
While many famous names appear in these files—including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, and Alan Dershowitz—their inclusion does not inherently imply criminal wrongdoing.24 Nevertheless, the "disciplined for less" argument remains poignant. Figures like Jes Staley were terminated for the *perception* of impropriety and the failure to disclose associations with a predator, whereas political figures have frequently survived such disclosures.18

### **The Evolution of Victim Testimony and Legal Standards**

The successful litigation by E. Jean Carroll highlights a shift in the American legal landscape. The passage of the Adult Survivors Act was specifically designed to provide a remedy for victims whose claims were barred by the passage of time.12 This shift suggests that while "discipline" in the form of job loss or social ostracization may be inconsistent, the legal system is increasingly providing mechanisms for a form of accountability that was previously inaccessible.  
The role of "outcry witnesses" and the admission of past patterns of behavior (propensity evidence) represent a second-order insight into how sexual assault cases are now tried.15 In the Carroll trial, the jury’s decision was influenced not just by Carroll’s word, but by the fact that multiple other women—Leeds and Stoynoff—described nearly identical mechanisms of assault.13 This cumulative evidentiary approach creates a higher degree of factual substantiation than has existed for many of the other \~28 accusers whose claims have not yet faced a judicial test.

## **Conclusion**

The historical record regarding Donald J. Trump and sexual misconduct includes at least 28 named claimants, one multi-million dollar civil judgment for sexual abuse, and a long-withdrawn allegation of child rape involving Jeffrey Epstein.1 While the judicial system has established liability in the Carroll case, the majority of the other 27 claims remain in a state of public record rather than legal fact.  
Comparatively, the disciplinary actions taken against others in the Epstein network reveal that institutional actors—such as Jes Staley, Leon Black, and Prince Andrew—have been held to a standard of conduct where associations, lack of transparency, or credible civil accusations led to the immediate termination of their professional lives.17 The fact that Trump has weathered 28 such accusations while others fell for "misleading a regulator" or "consulting fees" underscores the unique resilience of political figures compared to their corporate or royal counterparts. The "disciplined for less" phenomenon is thus a reflection of the differing accountabilities of the boardroom versus the ballot box.  
As more files from the Epstein investigation are released and more survivors utilize statutes like the Adult Survivors Act, the boundary between public allegation and legal substantiation will likely continue to shift, further refining the historical understanding of these events and their long-term consequences for those involved.
