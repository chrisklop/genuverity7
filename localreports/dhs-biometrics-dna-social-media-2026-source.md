# **Vetting and Biometric Surveillance in U.S. Immigration: A Technical and Legal Analysis (2025-2026)**

In late 2025 and early 2026, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State (DOS) introduced a series of regulatory updates and executive mandates aimed at expanding the collection of biometric and digital data. These measures represent a shift toward "continuous vetting" and high-fidelity identity management for both foreign nationals and associated U.S. citizens. This report analyzes the scope of these new policies, their statutory roots, the rights currently affected, and the likely outcomes of ongoing legal challenges.

## **Analysis of the 2025-2026 Policy Expansions**

The current regulatory landscape is defined by two primary administrative actions: a DHS proposed rule for USCIS biometrics and a CBP information collection request for the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).

### **The DHS Biometrics Proposed Rule (90 FR 49062\)**

Published on November 3, 2025, this rule seeks to fundamentally expand the definition and collection of biometrics within the immigration system.

* **Expanded Modalities:** The rule expands the definition of "biometrics" beyond traditional fingerprints and photographs to include palm prints, voice prints, "ocular imagery" (iris and retina scans), and DNA.  
* **Removal of Age Exemptions:** Historically, children under 14 and seniors over 79 were generally exempt from biometric requirements. The new rule removes these limits, allowing the government to collect data from individuals of any age, including infants.  
* **Continuous Vetting:** The policy shifts from point-in-time checks to a "recurring" basis, requiring individuals to provide updated biometrics throughout their stay in the U.S. until they achieve naturalization.  
* **Associated Individuals:** For the first time, biometrics can be required from U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) who are "associated" with an immigration benefit request, such as family petitioners or employer signatories.1

### **The CBP ESTA and Social Media Mandate**

On December 10, 2025, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposed updates to the ESTA program affecting visitors from 42 visa-waiver countries.

* **Mandatory Digital History:** Applicants must provide five years of social media identifiers (handles/accounts), 10 years of email addresses, and five years of telephone numbers.  
* **Biometric Inclusion:** The proposal states CBP will collect biometrics—including facial imagery, DNA, and iris scans—from ESTA travelers "when feasible".  
* **Mobile-Only Platform:** CBP plans to decommission the ESTA website in favor of a mobile-only application that utilizes "liveness detection" on selfie uploads to prevent identity fraud.

## **Statutory and Executive Roots**

The administration cites several authorities to justify these expansions, though critics argue the agency is exceeding its Congressional mandate.

1. **Executive Order 14161 (January 20, 2025):** Titled "Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats," this order directs federal agencies to implement "extreme vetting" and tighten visa processing.  
2. **DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005:** DHS relies on this statute, which authorized DNA collection from "non-U.S. persons" detained by federal authorities. However, the new policy expands this to civil benefit applicants and U.S. citizens, which critics argue is not supported by the original text.  
3. **Section 212(f) of the INA:** This provision gives the President broad authority to suspend the entry of any class of aliens deemed detrimental to U.S. interests, serving as the basis for the January 2026 pause on immigrant visas for 75 countries.4  
4. **Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025:** While not a government document, many of the policies (mass deportation engines, dismantling of asylum, and ending birthright citizenship) align with the "Mandate for Leadership" blueprint authored by former and current administration officials.

## **Rights Impact: Impeded vs. At-Risk**

The transition to this new framework has already impacted certain rights, while others remain at risk depending on the finalization of the rules.

### **Rights Already Impeded or Taken**

* **Privacy of Non-Citizens:** As of December 26, 2025, a final rule took effect requiring nearly all non-U.S. citizens to provide biometric data (photos and sometimes fingerprints) upon both entry and departure.  
* **Digital Privacy for Workers:** As of December 15, 2025, H-1B and H-4 visa applicants must undergo an "online presence review" and are instructed to set their social media profiles to "public" for government inspection.  
* **Citizenship Interpretation:** Executive Order 14160 (January 2025\) directed agencies to stop recognizing birthright citizenship for children of parents who are unlawfully present or in temporary status, fundamentally challenging traditional interpretations of the 14th Amendment.

### **Rights At Risk (Pending Finalization)**

* **Fourth Amendment Protections:** The proposed DNA rule for citizens and infants is viewed by legal experts as a "genetic dragnet." Compelling DNA in a civil, non-criminal context is argued to be an unreasonable search.  
* **First Amendment/Freedom of Expression:** Mandatory social media disclosure is expected to have a "chilling effect" on speech, as travelers may self-censor online activity to avoid being flagged by AI tools scanning for "hostile attitudes".  
* **Right of Association:** U.S. citizens' ability to sponsor family members or employees is being conditioned on their willingness to surrender biological data to a permanent government database.1

## **Judicial Outlook and Key Legal Hurdles**

The likelihood of these policies becoming permanent law depends on their survival in federal court. Advocacy groups like the ACLU and the Institute for Justice have already filed thousands of negative comments, the first step in a legal challenge.

| Legal Doctrine | Application to 2026 Policies | Likely Judicial Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Major Questions Doctrine** | Agencies cannot claim "highly consequential power" (like national DNA databases) without clear Congressional authorization. | Likely to be used to block the DNA requirement for U.S. citizens. |
| **Fourth Amendment** | *Maryland v. King* (2013) allows DNA for serious arrests, but not necessarily for civil benefit applications. | Courts may find suspicionless collection from infants and non-criminals unconstitutional. |
| **Administrative Procedure Act (APA)** | Agencies must provide a rational connection between the data collected and the goal (e.g., DNA for security).6 | Rules may be struck down if found "arbitrary or capricious" due to lack of evidence that DNA improves identity verification over fingerprints. |

**Conclusion:** While the administration has the executive authority to tighten border vetting, the expansion into genetic profiling of citizens and mandatory public social media for visitors faces significant constitutional and statutory barriers. Observers expect the digital vetting components to proceed more easily than the biological (DNA) components, which are likely to be stayed by federal courts in early 2026\.
