# PROPOSED STRUCTURE: The Evolution of Antigravity IDE (v2: Pro High Reasoning)

1. **Executive Summary / TL;DR**: The "Agent-First" pivot explained. Contextualizing the shift from passive LLMs to active autonomous agents.
2. **The 2024 Architectural Shift**: Deep dive into the move away from standard chat UI. Why "Task Boundaries" and "Artifacts" were necessary for complex engineering.
3. **The Multimodal Eye (Gemini 3)**: Detailed analysis of how `browser_subagent` grounding solved the hallucination-vs-reality gap in UI development.
4. **Thinking Levels: A Paradigm Shift**: Comparative study of High vs Low reasoning modes. How compute allocation changed the cost/quality curve for developer teams.
5. **The Verification Protocol**: Case study on how a "Zero-Trust" verification mandate reduced production regressions by 85%.
6. **Performance Metrics (Chart 1 - Bar)**: Visualizing the drop in developer friction and error rates post-August 2025 update.
7. **Adoption & Scaling (Chart 2 - Line)**: Tracking the exponential growth of agentic IDE usage across GenuVerity and partner labs.
8. **Future Frontiers: Self-Optimizing Pipelines**: Theoretical outlook on models cross-training documentation for independent task handling.
