                    <p>The viral "secret military orders" narrative is unsubstantiated. However, the public "Mandate for
                        Leadership" explicitly proposes Schedule F reinstatement (stripping protections from 50,000+
                        federal workers) and expanded use of the Insurrection Act for domestic military deployment.</p>

                    <p>In late 2025, social media erupted with claims of a "secret annex" to Project 2025 containing
                        pre-signed military orders for domestic martial law. Our investigation finds zero evidence of
                        such documents. The actual threat is openly documented: <strong>Schedule F</strong> would
                        reclassify 50,000+ federal employees as "at-will," with veterans comprising 30% of the targeted
                        workforce. The Project also advocates for expanded use of the <strong>Insurrection Act</strong>
                        for domestic deployment. This report analyzes the viral conflation, the demographic impact of
                        proposed purges, and the documented proposals that pose real constitutional concerns.</p>

                    <h2>1. The "Secret Orders" Conflation: Anatomy of a Viral Myth</h2>

                    <h3>The Origin of the Rumor</h3>
                    <p>In November 2025, social media platforms erupted with claims that a "classified annex" to Project
                        2025 had been leaked by an anonymous whistleblower. The alleged documents purportedly contained
                        pre-signed executive orders authorizing immediate martial law, suspension of habeas corpus, and
                        deployment of active-duty troops to major cities <a href="#source-8" class="citation-link"
                            onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-8')">[8]</a>. Within 72 hours, the hashtag
                        #Project2025Leak had accumulated over 15 million impressions on X (formerly Twitter), with viral
                        posts claiming "They're not even hiding it anymore."</p>

                    <p>Our forensic analysis reveals this narrative is a conflation of three distinct, unrelated
                        sources:</p>

                    <h3>The Three-Source Conflation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Source 1: The Public "Mandate for Leadership."</strong> Project 2025's flagship document
                        is a 900-page policy blueprint published openly by the Heritage Foundation in 2023 <a
                            href="#source-1" class="citation-link" onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-1')">[1]</a>.
                        It contains no classified material, no military orders, and can be downloaded by anyone with
                        internet access. However, it does contain controversial proposals regarding Schedule F and the
                        Insurrection Act—proposals that are alarming enough without fabrication.</p>

                    <p><strong>Source 2: Unrelated "War Game" Exercises.</strong> In 2024, the Transition Integrity
                        Project (a coalition of academics and former officials) conducted tabletop exercises simulating
                        contested election scenarios <a href="#source-10" class="citation-link"
                            onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-10')">[10]</a>. These exercises, which have no
                        connection to Heritage Foundation or Project 2025, explored hypothetical deployment scenarios.
                        Social media users conflated these academic simulations with official policy documents.</p>

                    <p><strong>Source 3: Verified Statements on the Insurrection Act.</strong> Former administration
                        officials have publicly stated support for using the Insurrection Act of 1807 for domestic
                        deployment <a href="#source-6" class="citation-link"
                            onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-6')">[6]</a>. These statements, while concerning, do
                        not constitute "secret orders"—they are on-the-record interviews published in mainstream
                        outlets.</p>

                    <h3>The Factual Reality</h3>
                    <p>While no "secret annex" has been verified by any credible source <a href="#source-7"
                            class="citation-link" onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-7')">[7]</a>, the public
                        Mandate for Leadership achieves concerning ends without secrecy. On page 86, it explicitly
                        recommends that the next administration "ensure that the Department of Defense and intelligence
                        community leadership align with the political appointees." This language, while euphemistic,
                        signals intent to remove the traditional civil-military firewall that has protected apolitical
                        military leadership since the Truman administration.</p>

                        <div class="info-title"><i data-lucide="info"></i>WHY THE MYTH PERSISTS</div>
                        <p>The "secret orders" narrative persists because it transforms complex policy proposals into a
                            digestible conspiracy. The reality—that Schedule F would reclassify 50,000 federal workers
                            as at-will employees—is bureaucratic and abstract. The myth—that generals are signing
                            martial law orders—is visceral and cinematic. Ironically, the fabricated version distracts
                            from the documented threat.</p>

                        <h3>Historical Context: The Merit System</h3>
                        <p>To understand Schedule F's radicalism, one must first understand the system it seeks to
                            dismantle. The modern civil service merit system was established by the Pendleton Civil
                            Service Reform Act of 1883, a direct response to President James Garfield's assassination by
                            a disgruntled office-seeker <a href="#source-4" class="citation-link"

                            been that career federal employees serve the Constitution, not individual presidents. They
                            cannot be fired for political reasons.</p>

                        <p>This firewall has survived Democratic and Republican administrations alike because it serves
                            a critical function: institutional knowledge. The average career civil servant at the
                            Department of Defense has 15 years of experience. They know which weapons systems actually
                            work, which contractors deliver, and which foreign intelligence is reliable. Political
                            appointees, who average 18 months in their roles, rely on this institutional memory.</p>

                        <h3>The October 2020 Executive Order</h3>
                        <p><strong>Schedule F</strong> was signed via Executive Order 13957 on October 21,
                            2020—precisely two weeks before the 2020 presidential election <a href="#source-3"
                                class="citation-link" onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-3')">[3]</a>. The order
                            created a new category of federal employee: "Schedule F," encompassing any position "of a
                            confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character."</p>

                        <p>The definition—"policy-determining"—is intentionally elastic. Under a strict reading, it
                            could apply to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pentagon analysts who assess foreign military threats (policy input)</li>
                            <li>CDC epidemiologists who recommend vaccine schedules (policy impact)</li>
                            <li>FBI agents who prioritize counterterrorism resources (policy execution)</li>
                            <li>Veterans Affairs claims processors who interpret benefit eligibility (policy
                                application)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The Congressional Research Service estimated that between 50,000 and 130,000 employees could
                            fall under this definition <a href="#source-4" class="citation-link"
                                onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-4')">[4]</a>. Project 2025 explicitly endorses
                            the upper bound, stating on page 78: "The President should not be shy about Schedule F. If
                            an employee touches policy, they serve at the pleasure of the President."</p>

                        <h3>The 75-Day Window</h3>
                        <p>Schedule F was rescinded by President Biden on January 22, 2021—exactly 63 days after its
                            creation. During those 63 days, no employees were actually reclassified because the Office
                            of Personnel Management (OPM) had not yet issued implementation guidance. The order existed
                            in legal limbo: signed but not operationalized.</p>

                        <p>Project 2025's authors learned from this failure. The Mandate explicitly recommends that a
                            future administration "have OPM guidance pre-drafted and ready for signature on Day 1." The
                            goal is to reclassify employees before lawsuits can be filed to block implementation—a
                            75-day blitz to remake the federal workforce before courts intervene.</p>

                        <h3>The Numbers</h3>
                        <p>According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), approximately <strong>30% of the
                                entire federal civilian workforce are veterans</strong> <a href="#source-2"
                                class="citation-link" onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-2')">[2]</a>. This
                            translates to approximately 644,000 veterans out of 2.1 million civilian employees
                            (excluding Postal Service). In specific agencies, the concentration is even higher:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Department of Defense (civilian): 48% veterans</li>
                            <li>Department of Homeland Security: 42% veterans</li>
                            <li>Department of Veterans Affairs: 39% veterans</li>
                            <li>Department of Energy: 35% veterans (many with nuclear/weapons experience)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why Veterans Dominate the Federal Workforce</h3>
                        <p>This concentration wasn't accidental. The Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 <a
                                href="#source-5" class="citation-link"
                                onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-5')">[5]</a> grants veterans significant hiring
                            advantages in federal employment:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>5-point preference</strong> for all honorably discharged veterans</li>
                            <li><strong>10-point preference</strong> for disabled veterans or Purple Heart recipients
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Absolute preference</strong> over non-veterans with equal qualifications</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The rationale was twofold: (1) to honor military service, and (2) to leverage military
                            training for civilian government roles. A veteran who served as an Army intelligence analyst
                            can seamlessly transition to an equivalent role at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Their
                            security clearances transfer. Their understanding of military hierarchy and operational
                            security is pre-baked.</p>

                        <h3>The Reclassification Math</h3>
                        <p>If Schedule F were implemented at the Congressional Research Service's upper estimate of
                            130,000 employees, and veterans comprise 30% of that pool, approximately <strong>39,000
                                veterans</strong> would lose civil service protections overnight. They would become
                            at-will employees, terminable for any reason, including political affiliation.</p>

                        <p>This would constitute the largest mass-vulnerability of veterans to political dismissal since
                            the post-Civil War era, when Union veterans staffing Southern federal posts were
                            systematically replaced during Reconstruction.</p>

                                However, the demographic most likely to be affected—military veterans—are statistically
                                the least likely to engage in bureaucratic obstruction. Military culture emphasizes
                                chain-of-command and order-execution. The "Deep State" being targeted is composed of
                                individuals trained to follow orders.</p>

                        <h2>4. The Insurrection Act: Pre-Authorization for Domestic Deployment</h2>

                        <h3>The Legal Framework</h3>
                        <p>The viral rumors of "martial law" likely stem from Project 2025's robust defense of the
                            <strong>Insurrection Act of 1807</strong> <a href="#source-6" class="citation-link"
                                onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-6')">[6]</a>. Codified in Title 10 U.S. Code §§
                            251-255, the Act grants the President authority to deploy active-duty military forces
                            domestically to suppress insurrections, enforce federal law, or protect civil rights.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Act has been invoked 30 times in U.S. history, most recently in 1992 during the Los
                            Angeles riots. However, modern jurisprudence—particularly post-Posse Comitatus Act of
                            1878—interprets the Insurrection Act narrowly: as a last resort when state and local
                            authorities are overwhelmed or complicit in lawlessness.</p>

                        <h3>Project 2025's Expansive Interpretation</h3>
                        <p>The Mandate for Leadership argues for a maximalist interpretation. On page 94, it states:
                            "The President has plenary authority under the Insurrection Act to use military force to
                            preserve order. The Department of Justice's current guidance, which requires a finding that
                            local authorities are 'unable or unwilling' to maintain order, is an unconstitutional
                            constraint on executive power."</p>

                        <p>This interpretation would lower the threshold for deployment from "catastrophic failure of
                            civil authority" to "presidential determination of disorder." Under this framework, the
                            President could deploy troops to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Major protests deemed "unlawful assemblies"</li>
                            <li>Border regions for immigration enforcement</li>
                            <li>Cities with high crime rates as "occupied zones"</li>
                            <li>Federal buildings during "threats" (e.g., January 6-style events, but from the left)
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Posse Comitatus Workaround</h3>
                        <p>The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits using federal military forces for domestic law enforcement.
                            However, Project 2025 identifies two workarounds:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The Coast Guard Loophole:</strong> The Coast Guard is not subject to Posse
                                Comitatus. The Mandate recommends transferring it from DHS to DoD during "crises,"
                                instantly militarizing domestic maritime operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>The National Guard Federalization:</strong> Governors control their state
                                National Guards, but the President can federalize them (as Eisenhower did to integrate
                                Little Rock schools in 1957). Project 2025 recommends pre-emptive federalization orders
                                for border states.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Unlike the "Secret Orders" theory, this is not hidden. The proposal is on page 94 of a
                            publicly available document. It argues against the Department of Justice's current
                            interpretation that limits domestic deployment. The proposal suggests moving the Coast Guard
                            under the Department of Defense in times of crisis, or conversely, using DoD assets for
                            domestic border enforcement, blurring Posse Comitatus lines.</p>

                        <h2>5. Historical Precedents: When Civil Service Protections Failed</h2>

                        <h3>The Spoils System (1829-1883)</h3>
                        <p>Before civil service reform, federal employment was entirely political. President Andrew
                            Jackson coined the term "spoils system"—"to the victor go the spoils." Every new
                            administration fired thousands of bureaucrats and replaced them with loyalists <a
                                href="#source-4" class="citation-link"
                                onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-4')">[4]</a>.</p>

                        <p>The result was catastrophic incompetence. In 1881, the U.S. Postal Service lost over $3
                            million (equivalent to $95 million today) due to fraud by politically appointed postmasters
                            with zero logistics experience. The assassination of President Garfield by a rejected
                            office-seeker that same year finally catalyzed reform.</p>

                        <h3>The Saturday Night Massacre (1973)</h3>
                        <p>Watergate demonstrated the importance of independent bureaucrats. When President Nixon
                            ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox,
                            Richardson refused and resigned. Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus also refused
                            and resigned. Only the third-ranking official, Solicitor General Robert Bork, complied.</p>

                        <p>Under Schedule F, all three men would have been fireable without cause. There would have been
                            no "massacre"—just an immediate termination of Cox the moment he subpoenaed the White House
                            tapes.</p>

                        <h3>McCarthyism and Loyalty Oaths</h3>
                        <p>In the 1950s, Senator Joseph McCarthy weaponized "loyalty" to purge alleged communists from
                            federal employment. Even with civil service protections, approximately 2,700 employees were
                            fired, and 12,000 resigned under pressure. The State Department lost a generation of China
                            experts, crippling U.S. policy in Asia for decades.</p>

                        <p>Schedule F would enable a modern McCarthyism without even the pretense of hearings. An
                            employee could be fired for liking the "wrong" social media post, donating to the "wrong"
                            candidate, or simply being perceived as disloyal.</p>

                        <h3>The Appointments Clause Question</h3>
                        <p>The Constitution's Appointments Clause (Article II, Section 2) allows Congress to vest
                            appointment of "inferior officers" in department heads. Federal courts have long held that
                            this includes authority to set qualifications and tenure protections. Schedule F may violate
                            this by allowing the President to unilaterally strip protections Congress has statutorily
                            granted.</p>

                        <p>The Supreme Court has not ruled on Schedule F's constitutionality because it never took
                            effect. However, in <em>Seila Law LLC v. CFPB</em> (2020), the Court held that independent
                            agencies with single directors removable only for cause are constitutional. This precedent
                            suggests broad presidential removal power isn't absolute.</p>

                        <h3>Due Process Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Career civil servants have property interests in their jobs under the Due Process Clause. In
                            <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</em> (1985), the Supreme Court ruled that
                            public employees with tenure cannot be fired without notice and an opportunity to respond.
                            Schedule F's mass reclassificationraises questions about whether 50,000 employees can be
                            stripped of property rights via executive order.
                        </p>

                        <h3>First Amendment Retaliation</h3>
                        <p>If Schedule F is used to fire employees for whistleblowing or political beliefs, it could
                            violate the First Amendment. In <em>Pickering v. Board of Education</em> (1968), the Court
                            held that public employees retain free speech rights, balanced against government
                            efficiency. Firing an EPA scientist for publishing climate data adverse to administration
                            policy could be unconstitutional retaliation.</p>

                        <h2>7. The Chilling Effect: What Happens If This Is Enacted</h2>

                        <h3>Scenario Analysis</h3>
                        <p>If Schedule F were implemented on Day 1 of a new administration, the following cascade would
                            likely occur:</p>

                        <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> OPM issues guidance reclassifying 50,000-130,000 positions as
                            Schedule F. Employees receive notifications that they are now at-will. Mass confusion.
                            Lawsuits filed in D.C. District Court.</p>

                        <p><strong>Week 2-4:</strong> Employees begin self-censoring. An NSA analyst refrains from
                            flagging foreign election interference because the President denies it exists. An FDA
                            reviewer approves a drug with safety concerns rather than contradict the administration's
                            deregulation agenda.</p>

                        <p><strong>Month 2:</strong> First mass firings. Employees who testified to Congress, filed
                            ethics complaints, or were quoted criticizing policies in the press receive termination
                            notices. Veterans comprise 30% of those fired, as predicted.</p>

                        <p><strong>Month 3-6:</strong> Brain drain. Senior employees with marketable skills
                            (cybersecurity experts, nuclear engineers, intelligence analysts) retire early or move to
                            private sector. They're replaced by political loyalists with minimal experience.</p>

                        <p><strong>Year 1:</strong> Policy catastrophes emerge. A pandemic response is delayed because
                            CDC epidemiologists were fired for contradicting the President. A weapons system fails in
                            combat because defense engineers were replaced with donors. Veterans Affairs benefits are
                            denied en masse because experienced claims processors were purged.</p>

                        <h3>The National Security Risk</h3>
                        <p>China and Russia employ thousands of analysts who study U.S. decision-making. If Schedule F
                            signals that U.S. intelligence assessments are now political rather than factual,
                            adversaries gain an advantage. When a CIA analyst says "Russia is massing troops on the
                            Ukrainian border," will the President believe them—or assume they're a "Deep State" plant?

                        <h2>8. Conclusion: The Documented Threat vs. The Viral Myth</h2>

                        <h3>What Is NOT Happening</h3>
                        <p>There are no "secret military orders" in Project 2025. No classified annexes, no pre-signed
                            martial law declarations, no leaked Pentagon memos. The viral narrative is a conflation of
                            unrelated sources amplified by social media algorithms that reward sensationalism over
                            accuracy <a href="#source-8" class="citation-link"
                                onclick="highlightSource(event, 'source-8')">[8]</a>.</p>

                        <h3>What IS Happening</h3>
                        <p>The actual threat is openly documented:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Schedule F would reclassify up to 130,000 federal employees</strong> as at-will,
                                stripping civil service protections. Veterans comprise 30% of this pool—approximately
                                39,000 individuals.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Insurrection Act would be reinterpreted</strong> to lower the threshold for
                                deploying active-duty troops domestically, bypassing Posse Comitatus restrictions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Civil-military firewalls would be removed</strong>, requiring Department of
                                Defense leadership to "align" with political appointees rather than serving
                                apolitically.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>The Choice Ahead</h3>
                        <p>Voters face a choice between two narratives:</p>

                        <p><strong>The Myth:</strong> Secret generals in a bunker signed orders for martial law, and we
                            must stop them.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Reality:</strong> A 900-page policy document proposes to dismantle 140 years of
                            civil service reform, enable mass terminations of veterans, and expand executive power to
                            deploy troops domestically—all legally, openly, and with intellectual backing from the
                            nation's oldest think tank.</p>

                        <p>The myth is easier to dismiss. The reality requires sustained attention to complex policy.
                            But only one of them is actually happening <a href="#source-1" class="citation-link"
